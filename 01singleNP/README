This script is used to generate the PDB and PSF for a DNA-grafted gold nanoparitcle

Model originated reference:
PRL 106, 215501 (2011)
Nano Lett, 12, 2509-2514 (2012)

usage:
python gen_SingleAuNP.py 
output:
DNP.pdb, DNP.psf

=========================
version 2012-5-22
gen_SingleAuNP.ad.py

The atom name and atom type is written in characters (not numbers) in the "ad" version

version 2012-6-29
gen_SingleAuNP.ad.py

1) The bond  between FL and LK is added;
2) a new type SS (single strand DNA bead) is added 
3) in the present version, the amount of single and double strand DNA bead should be larger than 1
   i.e.,  Lsstrand + Lscpaer >= 1
